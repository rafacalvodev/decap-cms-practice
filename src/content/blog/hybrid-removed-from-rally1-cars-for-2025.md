Hybrid power will been ditched from Rally1 cars at the end of this season.

The news, as predicted by DirtFish last month, came via an electronic vote from the FIA’s World Motor Sport Council on Friday.

In its communication of the news, the governing body stated: “Rally1 cars will be lighter, easier to drive, less complex to maintain, cheaper to use, but just as spectacular to watch when the 2025 season fires up.”

As outlined last month, DirtFish understands the changes to the repair of the hybrid units was a contributing factor in the series’ latest regulation twist.

## Comments by FIA chief technical and safety officer Xavier Mestelan-Pinon

FIA chief technical and safety officer Xavier Mestelan-Pinon said: “Following extensive dialogue with key stakeholders, it became clear that continuing to use the plug-in hybrid units provided under the existing supplier agreement was no longer in the best interests of the FIA World Rally Championship.

“We can now move forward in full confidence that the WRC becomes even better and stronger, with developments that are in line with the working perspective for the 2027 technical regulations.

“Once again, we have highlighted the championship’s ability to adapt without diluting the sporting spectacle, while responsibly embracing the challenges of our times. We are also pleased that the use of 100 per cent sustainable fuel remains a cornerstone of the championship’s commitment to reducing its environmental impact.”

The removal of the Compact Dynamics-supplied hybrid kit means the minimum weight of Rally1 cars will be lowered from 1260kg to 1180kg in time for 2025. The air restrictor will also be trimmed from 36 to 35mm in order to maintain a similar power-to-weight ratio from this season into next. The cars are expected to develop around 380bhp.

Almost 12 months ago, the FIA’s World Motor Sport Council established a WRC working group looking at every aspect of the WRC’s regulations. Months of speculation followed, with the loss of hybrid talked about alongside a potential Rally2-plus car. WMSC confirmed hybrid would be dropped in February of this year before hybrid was reinstated in June.

DirtFish understands Compact Dynamics has an agreement to supply hybrid to Rally1 cars until the end of 2026. DirtFish has sought comment from Compact Dynamics.

## Comments by FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem

FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem said his organizations third major regulation U-turn of the season offered the best solution for the sport.



He said: “The rich heritage and unique appeal of this sport, which is so dear to my heart, are invaluable, and we are committed to safeguarding its future. This development is important not only for the championship’s stakeholders to adapt to the evolving energy landscape, but also for containing costs. By focusing on sustainable fuel and simplifying car technology, we’re ensuring the WRC remains captivating for fans and achievable for competitors.”



WRC Promoter’s senior director sport Peter Thul said he was in favor of the change, telling DirtFish: “We are fully supportive of the removal of the current hybridization. It guarantees less complexity as well as putting a bigger focus on sustainable fuel, of which the WRC was a pioneer of.



“Furthermore, it helps reduce the cost for competitors. We saw this year when Mārtiņš Sesks ran without hybrid in Poland that he was still competitive, so it allays any concerns that the Rally1 cars will be any less spectacular next year.”
